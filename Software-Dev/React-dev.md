## #1: React docs
- There is no better resource than the documentation pages of the library you’re learning from.
- The Facebook documentation on React has basic, and advance concepts that will help you really get up to speed.
- It also contains documentation of the syntax, and examples on how to accomplish certain tasks.

## #2: React tutorial
- The React documentation site also has a nice tutorial to follow up with.
- It helps you start writing React code, learn about the developer tools, learn about state and props, and build a small game.

## #4: Egghead – Start Learning React
- Egghead is a great website that has a bunch of React courses by other contributors.
- But the one I recommend is a course called, “Start Learning React” by Joe Maddalone.
- The course is 66 minutes long and it’s rated at 4.3 rating out of 310 rating. You won’t be disappointed.
