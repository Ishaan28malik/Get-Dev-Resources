Data Science Foundation
1. Foundational Skills
Foundational skills form the basis of true understanding, which will in turn allow you to discover novel solutions, build more accurate models, and make better decisions.

1.1. Programming and Data Wrangling
First, you'll need to know at least one scripting language well enough to wrangle datasets, prototype models, and perform analyses.

We strongly recommend choosing between Python or R, as they are both open-source (free), widely adopted, and supported by active communities. They each have their own strengths, but we recommend picking just one at the start.

Python is more common in software startups, large tech firms, and adTech. Python tends to be more flexible because it's a general purpose programming language. It's also better for deep learning and processing data.
R / RStudio is popular in research, finance, and analytics. R is a statistical programming language that has mature libraries for econometrics, statistics, and machine learning.
We've also written a more detailed comparison of Python vs. R for data science.
If you're still on the fence, we'd recommend starting with Python due to its breadth and flexibility (and it's a bit more beginner-friendly).

Data Science Technical Skills
2. Technical Skills
Data science is all about converting raw data into insights, predictions, software, and so on. Therefore, you'll need to be comfortable working with data.

Core technical skills include collecting, cleaning, managing, and visualizing data, plus the big umbrella of applied machine learning.

2.1. Data Collection
Everything hinges on the quality and quantity of your data. Just as a chemist needs the right chemicals, you'll need relevant data.

There are 4 common ways to collect data:

Internal Data. This is proprietary data that your company collects through its operations or through partnerships with other providers. This is usually the most relevant data.
Searching Online. Need a labeled set of 8 million videos? There's a webpage for that... Seriously, you'd be surprised at what you can find out there. Online datasets allow you to prototype before investing in proprietary data.
API's. API's allow you to programmatically (and legally) access datasets that other companies collect. You can find anything from Twitter feeds to weather data to financial data.
Web Scraping. Web crawling and scraping is a powerful tool that you must use responsibly. It opens a whole new world, but make sure to respect terms of services.

Data Science Business Skills
3. Business Skills
Business skills and soft skills are sometimes overlooked in data science curricula, but they are supremely important, and employers will look out for them.

Data science is never performed in a vacuum. You'll need to anticipate business needs, think creatively about solutions, and communicate your insights clearly.

As machine learning libraries mature and algorithms become easier to use "out-of-the-box," businesses will value people who can work with data and work with people. This section of our list of data science resources will help you stand out.

3.1. Communication
If a tree falls in a forest but no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? If data is analyzed but no one can explain the results, does it really matter?

Effective communication skills are universal, but data scientists have the added challenge of discussing highly technical or mathematical topics.

During data scientist interviews, you'll often be asked to "explain a technical concept to a layperson" or "describe a previous project you've worked on." Employers will specifically look for clarity, conciseness, and organization.

3.2. Creativity & Innovation
Data scientists are hired to build new products, perform complex analyses, and invent valuable ways to use data.

In fact, they rarely solve the same problem twice. Even if you can apply the same methods to an adjacent dataset, you'll need to be creative about feature engineering, supplemental data, and business implications.

You'll naturally become a better creative thinker as you gain more experience, but the following resources can help jumpstart your problem-solving and innovation skills.
