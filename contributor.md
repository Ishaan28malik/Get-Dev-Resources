## Adding Content to the Remote Repository
   Now that you have a change made to the repository, you’ll need to track and save that change. The first step in tracking your change is to add it to the version you’re working on. 
   To do that, you need to execute the command `git add .` 
   
   
   Next, commit your change and add a message so that other developers who are collaborating on the project will know about the changes you’ve made.
   You can do that by executing this command  `git commit -m "your commit message"` 


   After committing, you’ll need to push changes from your local machine to the remote repository on GitHub. 
   To do this, execute the command `git push`.
   
## Creating a Pull Request
